This repository has one additional file besides the readme: working_version_snapshot.txt

You can get a word wrapped web page of this file by clicking on the filename above and then clicking on the "raw" button.

The document will still look very ugly, and it will be hard to read. You might save it to a local rich text file, change the whole document to the font of your choice, and then output that text file as a pdf. It will still be hard to read, but less so, and you won't have to be worried about accidentally editing something. (If you do accidentally edit something, you can always download the file again.)

Eventually this document will be formatted nicely, but it's easier to edit the document as a simple text file. (There is formatting consistency, though it's not perfect: Three blank lines are used for major section breaks. Two blank lines are used for minor section breaks.)

There are two tables of contents that make use of tab indents. Once you get used to visually parsing them, then you can work to understand the structure and intent of the whole document. And, it will be easier to navigate the document by searching for the table of contents headers.

So, right now, for better or worse, the formatting (or lack thereof) of the material is a barrier to entry. But that won't be the case in the future. Things are still very optimized for creation rather than distribution. But the material can still be effectively consumed with some front-end effort.
