# Instructions / Read This First

This repository has one additional file besides the readme:

working_version_snapshot.txt

If you just click on that filename, above, in blue, in the file list, THE CONTENT WILL NOT BE WORD-WRAPPED, and trying to read it will be confusing, frustrating, or it might seem like too much effort to deal with.

To get a word wrapped version, do click on the filename, above, and then, on the next page, click on the "raw" button a bit up and to the right.

The document will still look very ugly and possibly hard to read. You might save it to a local rich text file, change the whole document to the font (and font size) of your choice, and then output that text file as a pdf. It may *still* be hard to read, but less so, and you won't have to be worry about accidentally editing something. (If you do accidentally edit something, you can always download the file again.)

Eventually this document will be formatted nicely, but it's easier, for me, to edit the document as a simple text file--and that does mean faster content updates. (There is actually formatting consistency, though it's not perfect: Three blank lines are used for major section breaks. Two blank lines are used for minor section breaks. Line-terminating colons signify headers.)

In the file, there are *two* tables of contents that make use of tab indents (one brief, on expanded). Once you get used to visually parsing them, you can then work to understand the structure and intent of the whole document. And, it will be easier to navigate the document by searching for the table of contents headers.

So, right now, for better or worse, the formatting (or lack thereof) of the material is a barrier to entry. But that won't be the case in the future. Things are still very optimized for creation rather than distribution. But the material can still be effectively consumed with some front-loaded effort.

Anyway, it's a long and highly structured document, though the "object-level prose" is often very, very messy, at least at this draft stage.

Because of its length, it can be helpful to see "diffs" of the differences between old and newer versions, which will help you see exactly what's changed. You can browse diffs by (a) looking for the word "commits," above, and clicking on it or (b) looking for the word "commit" (no 's')  and clicking on the string of characters to the right of it. You may need an additional click somewhere to load the diff because of the relatively large file size.
